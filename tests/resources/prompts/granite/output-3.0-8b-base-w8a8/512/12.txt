Question:
Write a Python function that uses `functools.lru_cache` to memoize the results of the Fibonacci sequence for faster computation of large numbers.


Answer:
```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

This code defines a function `fibonacci` that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion. The `functools.lru_cache` decorator is used to memoize the results of the function, which means that the function will store the results of previous calculations in a cache and return the cached result if the same input is provided again. This can significantly improve the performance of the function for large inputs.

The `maxsize` parameter of the `lru_cache` decorator is set to `None`, which means that the cache will not have a size limit and will store all the results of previous calculations. If you want to limit the size of the cache, you can set the `maxsize` parameter to a positive integer.

The `fibonacci` function uses recursion to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. The base case is when `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns `n`. Otherwise, the function returns the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers.
