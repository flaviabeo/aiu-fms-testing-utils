Question:
Write a Julia function that performs matrix multiplication on two large matrices and utilizes Julia's `@distributed` macro to parallelize the computation across multiple CPU cores.


Answer:
```julia
using Distributed

function parallel_matrix_multiplication(A, B)
    # Add workers
    addprocs(Sys.CPU_CORES)

    # Distribute matrices
    A_dist = distribute(A)
    B_dist = distribute(B)

    # Perform matrix multiplication in parallel
    C_dist = @distributed (+) for i in 1:size(A, 1)
        row = zeros(size(B, 2))
        for j in 1:size(B, 2)
            for k in 1:size(A, 2)
                row[j] += A_dist[i, k] * B_dist[k, j]
            end
        end
        row
    end

    # Gather results
    C = gather(C_dist)

    # Remove workers
    rmprocs(workers())

    return C
end
```

This function first adds the number of CPU cores as workers using `addprocs(Sys.CPU_CORES)`. It then distributes the input matrices `A` and `B` across the workers using `distribute(A)` and `distribute(B)`. The matrix multiplication is performed in parallel using the `@distributed` macro, which distributes the loop iterations across the workers. The results are gathered using `gather(C_dist)` and returned. Finally, the workers are removed using `rmprocs(workers())`.

This function can be used to perform matrix multiplication on large matrices in parallel, utilizing Julia's distributed computing capabilities.
