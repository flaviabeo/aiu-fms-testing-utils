Answer:
```
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. PAYROLL.
DATA DIVISION.
FILE SECTION.
FD EMPLOYEE-RECORD.
01 EMPLOYEE-RECORD.
05 EMPLOYEE-NAME PIC X(20).
05 EMPLOYEE-DEPARTMENT PIC X(10).
05 EMPLOYEE-SALARY PIC S9(5)V99 COMP.
WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
01 TOTAL-PAYROLL PIC S9(10)V99 COMP.
01 DEPARTMENT-RECORD.
05 DEPARTMENT-NAME PIC X(20).
05 DEPARTMENT-TOTAL-SALARY PIC S9(5)V99 COMP.
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
MAIN-PROCEDURE.
OPEN INPUT EMPLOYEE-RECORD.
OPEN OUTPUT DEPARTMENT-RECORD.
PERFORM UNTIL EOF-EMPLOYEE-RECORD.
READ EMPLOYEE-RECORD.
ADD EMPLOYEE-SALARY TO TOTAL-PAYROLL.
IF EMPLOYEE-DEPARTMENT = DEPARTMENT-NAME
ADD EMPLOYEE-SALARY TO DEPARTMENT-TOTAL-SALARY.
END-IF.
END-PERFORM.
SORT DEPARTMENT-RECORD ON DEPARTMENT-NAME.
DISPLAY "Total Payroll: " TOTAL-PAYROLL.
DISPLAY "Department Report:".
PERFORM UNTIL EOF-DEPARTMENT-RECORD.
READ DEPARTMENT-RECORD.
DISPLAY DEPARTMENT-NAME.
DISPLAY "Total Salary: " DEPARTMENT-TOTAL-SALARY.
END-PERFORM.
CLOSE EMPLOYEE-RECORD.
CLOSE DEPARTMENT-RECORD.
STOP RUN.
```

This COBOL program reads employee records from a flat file, calculates the total payroll, and generates a report sorted by department. The program uses the SORT statement to sort the department records by department name. The program then displays the total payroll and the department report.<|endoftext|>
