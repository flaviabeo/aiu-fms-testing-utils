Solve the following coding problem. Wrap your code answer using ```


Question:
Write a JAX program that demonstrates vectorized operations by performing element-wise addition, multiplication, and exponentiation on two large arrays using `jax.numpy`.


Answer:
```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Define two large arrays
arr1 = jnp.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr2 = jnp.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

# Perform element-wise addition
result_add = jnp.add(arr1, arr2)

# Perform element-wise multiplication
result_mul = jnp.multiply(arr1, arr2)

# Perform element-wise exponentiation
result_exp = jnp.power(arr1, arr2)

# Print the results
print("Element-wise addition:", result_add)
print("Element-wise multiplication:", result_mul)
print("Element-wise exponentiation:", result_exp)
```

This JAX program demonstrates vectorized operations by performing element-wise addition, multiplication, and exponentiation on two large arrays using `jax.numpy`. The results are printed to the console.
