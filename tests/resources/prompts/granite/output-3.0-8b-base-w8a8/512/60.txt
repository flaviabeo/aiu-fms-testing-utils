Question:
Implement a Python metaclass that modifies the creation of classes by automatically adding a method `describe()` to any class that uses this metaclass. The `describe()` method should return a string with the class name.


Answer:

```python
class MetaClass(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        attrs['describe'] = lambda self: name
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)

class MyClass(metaclass=MetaClass):
    pass

my_instance = MyClass()
print(my_instance.describe())  # Output: MyClass
```

In this solution, we define a metaclass `MetaClass` that inherits from `type`. The `__new__` method is overridden to add a `describe` method to the class. This method returns the class name when called. The `MyClass` class is then defined with `MetaClass` as its metaclass, and an instance of `MyClass` is created. When the `describe` method is called on this instance, it returns the class name, "MyClass".<|endoftext|>
