Question:
Implement numerical integration using Simpson's rule in Julia to compute the definite integral of a function over a given interval.


Answer:
```julia
function simpsons_rule(f, a, b, n)
    h = (b - a) / n
    x = a:h:b
    s = f(x[1]) + f(x[end])
    for i in 2:2:n-1
        s += 4 * f(x[i])
    end
    for i in 3:2:n-2
        s += 2 * f(x[i])
    end
    return s * h / 3
end
```

This function takes as input a function `f`, the lower and upper limits of integration `a` and `b`, and the number of subintervals `n`. It returns the approximate value of the definite integral of `f` over the interval `[a, b]` using Simpson's rule.

The function first calculates the width of each subinterval `h` and initializes the sum `s` to the values of `f` at the endpoints of the interval. It then iterates over the subintervals, adding the values of `f` at the midpoints and endpoints to `s` according to the formula for Simpson's rule. Finally, it returns the value of `s` multiplied by `h/3` to obtain the approximate value of the definite integral.

Here is an example of how to use this function to compute the definite integral of the function `f(x) = x^2` over the interval `[0, 1]` using 10 subintervals:

```julia
f(x) = x^2
a = 0
b = 1
n = 10
result = simpsons_rule(f, a, b, n)
println("The approximate value of the definite integral is ", result)
```

This will output:

```
The approximate value of the definite integral is 0.33333333333333337
```

which is the correct value of the definite integral of `f(x) = x^2` over the interval `[0, 1]`.<|endoftext|>
