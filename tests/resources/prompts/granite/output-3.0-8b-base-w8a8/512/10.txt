Question:
Write a C++ template function that swaps the values of two variables, regardless of their data type.


Answer:
```cpp
template <typename T>
void swap(T& a, T& b) {
    T temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
```

This function uses a temporary variable to swap the values of two variables of any data type. The function is a template function, which means it can be used with any data type. The `&` symbol is used to pass the variables by reference, which allows the function to modify the original variables.<|endoftext|>
