Question:
Write an Assembly program that multiplies two integers provided as input and stores the result in a register. Use the x86 architecture.


Answer:
```
section .data
    num1 dd 5
    num2 dd 10

section .bss
    result resd 1

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Load the first number into the EAX register
    mov eax, [num1]

    ; Load the second number into the EBX register
    mov ebx, [num2]

    ; Multiply the numbers and store the result in the EDX register
    mul ebx

    ; Store the result in the result variable
    mov [result], eax

    ; Exit the program
    mov eax, 1
    xor ebx, ebx
    int 0x80
```

This Assembly program multiplies two integers provided as input and stores the result in the EDX register. The input numbers are stored in the `num1` and `num2` variables in the `.data` section. The result is stored in the `result` variable in the `.bss` section. The program uses the x86 architecture and the NASM assembler.

The program starts by loading the first number into the EAX register using the `mov` instruction. Then, it loads the second number into the EBX register. The `mul` instruction multiplies the numbers in the EAX and EBX registers and stores the result in the EDX:EAX register pair. The program then stores the result in the `result` variable using the `mov` instruction. Finally, the program exits using the `int 0x80` instruction with the `eax` register set to 1 and the `ebx` register set to 0.<|endoftext|>
