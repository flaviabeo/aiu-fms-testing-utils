Solve the following coding problem. Wrap your code answer using ```


Question:
Create a Bash script that compresses all `.txt` files in a directory into a `.zip` file, but excludes files that are larger than 1MB.


Answer:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the directory is provided as an argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Please provide a directory as an argument."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the directory exists
if [ ! -d "$1" ]; then
  echo "The provided directory does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

# Create a zip file with the same name as the directory
zip_file="${1}.zip"

# Compress all .txt files in the directory into the zip file, excluding files larger than 1MB
find "$1" -type f -name "*.txt" -size -1M -exec zip -r "$zip_file" {} \;

# Display a success message
echo "All .txt files in the directory have been compressed into $zip_file."
```

This script first checks if a directory is provided as an argument and if it exists. If not, it displays an error message and exits. Then, it creates a zip file with the same name as the directory. Finally, it compresses all `.txt` files in the directory into the zip file, excluding files larger than 1MB, and displays a success message.<|endoftext|>
