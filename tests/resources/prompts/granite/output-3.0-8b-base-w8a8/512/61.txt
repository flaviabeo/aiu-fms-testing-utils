Question:
Write a Python context manager class using `__enter__()` and `__exit()__` that measures the execution time of the code block within the context and prints the duration when exiting the block.


Answer:
```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start = time.time()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.end = time.time()
        print(f"Duration: {self.end - self.start} seconds")

with Timer():
    # Code block to measure execution time
    time.sleep(1)
```

This code defines a context manager class `Timer` with `__enter__()` and `__exit()__` methods. The `__enter__()` method initializes the start time, and the `__exit__()` method calculates the duration by subtracting the start time from the end time. The context manager is used with the `with` statement to measure the execution time of the code block within the context.<|endoftext|>
