Solve the following coding problem. Wrap your code answer using ```


Question:
Write a SQL query that joins two tables, `orders` and `customers`, and retrieves the top 5 customers who have placed the highest number of orders in the past year.


Answer:
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name
ORDER BY total_orders DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

This query joins the `customers` and `orders` tables on the `customer_id` field. It then filters the orders to only include those placed in the past year using the `WHERE` clause. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `customer_id` and `customer_name`, and the `COUNT(o.order_id)` function counts the number of orders for each customer. The results are then ordered by the total number of orders in descending order, and the `LIMIT` clause restricts the output to the top 5 customers.<|endoftext|>
