Question:
Write a function in JavaScript that debounces an input function such that it's only called once, after the input has stopped being called for a specific delay (e.g., for implementing searc bar auto-suggestions).


Answer:

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeout;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}
```

This function takes a function `func` and a delay `delay` as arguments. It returns a new function that, when called, clears any existing timeout and sets a new one to call `func` after the specified delay. This effectively debounces the function, ensuring it's only called once after the input has stopped being called for the specified delay.<|endoftext|>
