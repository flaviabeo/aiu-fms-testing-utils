Question:
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the second largest number in the list. If the list has less than two elements, the function should return None.


Answer:
```python
def second_largest(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return None

    largest = max(numbers[0], numbers[1])
    second_largest = min(numbers[0], numbers[1])

    for num in numbers[2:]:
        if num > largest:
            second_largest = largest
            largest = num
        elif num > second_largest and num != largest:
            second_largest = num

    return second_largest
