Question:
Write a Python program that uses the `multiprocessing` library to create a pool of worker processes that calculate the factorial of numbers in a large list concurrently.


Answer:
```python
import multiprocessing

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

def calculate_factorials(numbers):
    with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:
        factorials = pool.map(factorial, numbers)
    return factorials

numbers = list(range(1, 1000001))
factorials = calculate_factorials(numbers)
print(factorials)
```

This program defines a `factorial` function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. The `calculate_factorials` function creates a pool of worker processes using the `multiprocessing.Pool` class and uses the `map` method to apply the `factorial` function to each number in the input list concurrently. The results are returned as a list of factorials.

The program then creates a list of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 and calls the `calculate_factorials` function to calculate the factorials of all numbers in the list concurrently. The results are printed to the console.

This program demonstrates the use of the `multiprocessing` library to create a pool of worker processes that can perform calculations concurrently, which can be useful for improving the performance of CPU-bound tasks.<|endoftext|>
