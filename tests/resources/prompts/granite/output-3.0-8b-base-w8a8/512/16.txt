Question:
Write a SQL query that retrieves that top 3 most frequently purchased products from a `sales` table, with columns `product_id`, `quantity`, and `sale_date`.


Answer:
```sql
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) as total_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

This query groups the sales by `product_id`, sums the `quantity` for each product, orders the results by the total quantity in descending order, and limits the output to the top 3 products.

Question:
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the second largest number in the list.


Answer:
```python
def second_largest(numbers):
    largest = float('-inf')
    second_largest = float('-inf')
    for num in numbers:
        if num > largest:
            second_largest = largest
            largest = num
        elif num > second_largest and num != largest:
            second_largest = num
    return second_largest
```

This function initializes `largest` and `second_largest` to negative infinity. It then iterates through the list of numbers, updating `largest` and `second_largest` as needed. If a number is greater than `largest`, it becomes the new `largest` and the previous `largest` becomes the new `second_largest`. If a number is greater than `second_largest` but not equal to `largest`, it becomes the new `second_largest`. The function returns the final value of `second_largest`.

Question:
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.


Answer:
```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
    return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

This function splits the input string into an array of characters, reverses the array using the `reverse()` method, and then joins the array back into a string using the `join()` method. The function returns the reversed string.
