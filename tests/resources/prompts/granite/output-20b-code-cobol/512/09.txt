Question:
Implement a Python function using `asyncio` to make multiple asynchronous web requests and return the first successful response, cancelling the rest.


Answer:
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp


async def fetch(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()


async def fetch_all(urls):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [asyncio.create_task(fetch(session, url)) for url in urls]
        done, pending = await asyncio.wait(tasks, return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED)
        return [task.result() for task in done]


urls = [
    'https://www.google.com',
    'https://www.yahoo.com',
    'https://www.bing.com',
    'https://www.duckduckgo.com',
]

results = asyncio.run(fetch_all(urls))
print(results)
```<|endoftext|>
