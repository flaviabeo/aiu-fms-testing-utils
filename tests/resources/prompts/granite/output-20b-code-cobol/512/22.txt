Question:
Write a Bash script that recursively searches for all files larger than 100MB within a given directory and moves them to a separate folder called `large_files`.


Answer:
#!/bin/bash

# Define the directory to search
dir=$1

# Create the large_files directory if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -d "$dir/large_files" ]; then
  mkdir "$dir/large_files"
fi

# Search for files larger than 100MB within the given directory
find "$dir" -type f -size +100M -exec mv {} "$dir/large_files" \;

# Print a message indicating the script has completed
echo "Large files have been moved to the large_files directory."
