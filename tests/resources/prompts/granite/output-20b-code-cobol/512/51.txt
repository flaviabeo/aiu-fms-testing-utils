Question:
Write a JAX program that demonstrates vectorized operations by performing element-wise addition, multiplication, and exponentiation on two large arrays using `jax.numpy`.


Answer:
```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Generate two large arrays
a = jnp.arange(10000000)
b = jnp.arange(10000000)

# Element-wise addition
c = a + b

# Element-wise multiplication
d = a * b

# Element-wise exponentiation
e = a ** 2

# Print the results
print(c)
print(d)
print(e)
```

This program demonstrates vectorized operations by performing element-wise addition, multiplication, and exponentiation on two large arrays using `jax.numpy`. The arrays `a` and `b` are generated using `jnp.arange`, which creates an array with evenly spaced values. The arrays `c`, `d`, and `e` are created by performing element-wise operations on `a` and `b`. Finally, the results are printed using `print`.<|endoftext|>
