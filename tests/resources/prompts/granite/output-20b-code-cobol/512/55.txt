Question:
Write a Bash script that accepts a list of filenames as input, checks if each file is writable, and if so, appends a timestamp to the end of each file.


Answer:
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the number of arguments is correct
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <file1> <file2> ..."
    exit 1
fi

# Loop through each file
for file in $@; do
    # Check if the file is writable
    if [ -w $file ]; then
        # Append a timestamp to the end of the file
        echo "Appending timestamp to $file"
        echo "$(date)" >> $file
    else
        echo "Error: $file is not writable"
    fi
done
