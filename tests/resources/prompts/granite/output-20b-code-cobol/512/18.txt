Solve the following coding problem. Wrap your code answer using ```


Question:
Create a Bash script that compresses all `.txt` files in a directory into a `.zip` file, but excludes files that are larger than 1MB.


Answer:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the directory path from the user
read -p "Enter the directory path: " dir_path

# Check if the directory exists
if [ ! -d "$dir_path" ]; then
  echo "Directory does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

# Create a temporary directory to store the compressed files
temp_dir=$(mktemp -d)

# Compress all .txt files in the directory into a .zip file, excluding files larger than 1MB
find "$dir_path" -type f -name "*.txt" -size -1M -exec zip -r "$temp_dir/compressed.zip" "{}" \;

# Print the path of the compressed file
echo "Compressed file: $temp_dir/compressed.zip"
