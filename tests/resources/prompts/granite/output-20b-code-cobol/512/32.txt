Question:
Build a Python function that creates an inference pipeline for a transformer model using the HuggingFace `pipeline()` API, The function should classify input text into one of several predefined categories.


Answer:
```python
from transformers import pipeline

def build_inference_pipeline(model_name, categories):
    """
    Builds an inference pipeline for a transformer model using the HuggingFace `pipeline()` API.

    Parameters:
    model_name (str): The name of the transformer model to use for inference.
    categories (list): A list of categories to classify input text into.

    Returns:
    pipeline: The inference pipeline.
    """

    # Load the model
    model = pipeline(model_name)

    # Define the inference pipeline
    def inference_pipeline(text):
        # Run the text through the model
        result = model(text)

        # Get the most likely category
        category = categories[result[0]['label']]

        return category

    return inference_pipeline
