Question:
Write a Bash script that monitors a directory for changes (file creation, deletion, or modification) and logs each event with a timestamp into a log file.


Answer:
#!/bin/bash

# Monitor a directory for changes (file creation, deletion, or modification) and log each event with a timestamp into a log file.

# Usage: ./monitor-directory.sh <directory> <log-file>

# Example: ./monitor-directory.sh /home/user/documents /home/user/logs/directory-events.log

# Exit if any command fails
set -e

# Check if the number of arguments is correct
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
  echo "Usage: ./monitor-directory.sh <directory> <log-file>"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the directory exists
if [ ! -d $1 ]; then
  echo "Directory $1 does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the log file exists
if [ ! -f $2 ]; then
  echo "Log file $2 does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

# Monitor the directory for changes
inotifywait -m -r -e create,delete,modify $1 | while read -r line; do
  # Get the current timestamp
  timestamp=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

  # Extract the event type and file path from the log line
  event=$(echo $line | cut -d ' ' -f 2)
  file_path=$(echo $line | cut -d ' ' -f 3)

  # Log the event with the timestamp
  echo "$timestamp - $event - $file_path" >> $2
done
