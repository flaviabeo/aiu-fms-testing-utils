FD  EMPLOYEE-DATA
    LABEL RECORDS STANDARD
    VALUE OF FILE-ID "EMPLOYEE-DATA"
    RECORD IS VARYING IN SIZE FROM 12 TO 128 CHARACTERS

   01  EMPLOYEE-RECORD.
       05  EMPLOYEE-ID     PIC X(8).
       05  EMPLOYEE-NAME.
           10  FIRST-NAME   PIC X(15).
           10  MIDDLE-INITIAL  PIC X.
           10  LAST-NAME    PIC X(20).
       05  EMPLOYEE-SALARY PIC S9(9)V99 COMP-3.

WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
01  REC-LENGTH               PIC 9(4) COMP-3 VALUE 0.
01  EMPLOYEE-THRESHOLD       PIC S9(9)V99 COMP-3.
01  EMPLOYEE-RECORD-COUNT    PIC 9(9) COMP-3 VALUE 0.
01  EMPLOYEE-RECORD-POINTER  PIC 9(9) COMP-3 VALUE 1.
01  EMPLOYEE-RECORD-STATUS   PIC 9(4) COMP-3.

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
MAIN-PROCEDURE.
    OPEN INPUT EMPLOYEE-DATA.
    PERFORM READ-RECORD
        UNTIL END-OF-FILE.
    CLOSE EMPLOYEE-DATA.
    STOP RUN.

READ-RECORD.
    READ EMPLOYEE-DATA
        AT END
            MOVE "END OF FILE" TO MESSAGE-TEXT
            PERFORM DISPLAY-MESSAGE
            GO TO END-OF-FILE.
    IF EMPLOYEE-RECORD-STATUS NOT = 0
        MOVE "ERROR READING RECORD" TO MESSAGE-TEXT
        PERFORM DISPLAY-MESSAGE
        GO TO END-OF-FILE.
    ADD 1 TO EMPLOYEE-RECORD-COUNT.
    IF EMPLOYEE-RECORD-COUNT > 1
        PERFORM DISPLAY-RECORD.
    IF EMPLOYEE-RECORD-SALARY > EMPLOYEE-THRESHOLD
        PERFORM DISPLAY-RECORD.
