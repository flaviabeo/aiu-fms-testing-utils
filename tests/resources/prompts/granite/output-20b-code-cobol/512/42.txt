Question:
Write a Julia function that performs matrix multiplication on two large matrices and utilizes Julia's `@distributed` macro to parallelize the computation across multiple CPU cores.


Answer:
```julia
using Distributed

function matrix_multiplication(A, B)
    C = zeros(size(A, 1), size(B, 2))
    @distributed for i in 1:size(A, 1)
        for j in 1:size(B, 2)
            for k in 1:size(A, 2)
                C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
            end
        end
    end
    return C
end
