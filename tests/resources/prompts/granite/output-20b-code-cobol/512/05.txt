Question:
Write a context manager in Python that logs the start and end time of any block of code executed within its context.


Answer:
Here's an example of a context manager that logs the start and end time of any block of code executed within its context:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start = time.time()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, *args):
        self.end = time.time()
        self.interval = self.end - self.start
        print(f"Elapsed time: {self.interval:.2f} seconds")

with Timer():
    # Code to be timed
    time.sleep(1)
```

This context manager can be used as follows:

```python
with Timer():
    # Code to be timed
    time.sleep(1)
```

The code within the context of the with statement will be timed and the elapsed time will be printed to the console.<|endoftext|>
